I spend A LOT of time underground. It's my happy place. But lately I haven't been able to get out in the field as much as I'd like, since work at the museum has been picking up. I was sooo jealous when Jess told me where she sent you. Lucky you! Turns out, the land is an absolute treasure trove for gems. Since you'll be finding a ton of gems while you mine, you wouldn't mind sending me some specimens for science, right? I can't wait to see what you find!","color":"white"}]
