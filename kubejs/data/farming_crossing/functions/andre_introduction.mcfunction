I'm retired now, but I must say, I'm enjoying it well enough. No losing sleep over managing the farm. No need to worry about logistics, the weather... I can focus my full attention on training my animals. The other day, I taught my chicken Bessie to roll over. She's a smart one, that hen. I even have time to help out at the Oyster Creek Zoo every now and then.","color":"white"}]
