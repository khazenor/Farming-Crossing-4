The world is my orchard. It can be yours too. Keep your eyes peeled, and you're bound to find nature's bounty on every branch and bough. Once you pick one - you'll be hooked! You know, you can make a good living off just selling wild fruit and nuts. As for me, I'm happy just keeping them all for myself. Ha!","color":"white"}]
