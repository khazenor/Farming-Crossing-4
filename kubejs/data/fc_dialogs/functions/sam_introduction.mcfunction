My life revolves around fish - I'm a sushi chef by day and a fisherman by night. When Jess told me you were considering a fishing career, I must say I was overjoyed. The delight of capturing your own fish and eating it the same day -- the fresh fatty umami taste melting on your tongue with every bite -- is one of the greatest pleasures in life. At least, that's how I see it. Fish is all I eat, all that sustains me. I hope that you will come to understand my point of view, and perhaps embrace it with me.","color":"white"}]
