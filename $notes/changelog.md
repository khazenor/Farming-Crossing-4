- You can look up foods of a category by typing the category name into JEI!
- If you notice foods that are missing classifications or are mis-classified. Feel free to submit a suggestion with this form!
  - https://forms.gle/UeJHcFtpSg13fHCk6
- If you eat more than 2 of one kind of food, you would start craving food of the opposite kind 
  - e.g. if you eaten two cake slices (sweet), then you would start craving something savory
- In winter/summer, your cravings for hot/cold foods would increase every time you eat a food.
- Cravings can stack! You can eat 2 sweet, heavy, and hot foods to get cravings for savory, light, and cold foods.
- When you eat a food that you are craving for, it will clear all existing potion effects you currently have and give you a random potion effect for each craving you satisfy.  The potion effect lasts 20 mins.  After that, your cravings will reset.

# 3.16:
## Release Notes
### There are changes to the collection logs in this update.
- In general it's good practice to backup your worlds and configs before updating.  And since there are updates to the collection logs, I would recommend testing out the animal observation quests with a backup of your world.
- To test, first make a back up of the world. Go into the world and trigger some observation quest (like the newly added camel and maybe some others).  If the server messages are appearing as expected and you can still complete collection achievements. Then all is clear!
### I've also added a script that checks for potential problem block placements when any players place blocks
- I've tested this on single player and my scripts doesn't seem to cause any performance problems.
- Server admins, you guys might want to monitor the server a bit around players placing blocks just to make sure they there is not a significant lag (though personally I think it's unlikely, just want to point out in case)

## Release Note
